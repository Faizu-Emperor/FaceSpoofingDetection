🚀 Face Anti-Spoofing Detection with YOLOv8 and Streamlit
This project demonstrates a real-time face anti-spoofing detection system using YOLOv8 and Streamlit. It classifies whether a detected face is real or fake based on a trained deep learning model.

The app runs directly in your browser and can be accessed on desktop or mobile. It's ideal for use cases like facial authentication, digital KYC, and biometric security systems.

🔍 Features
✅ Real-time webcam-based face detection

✅ Spoof (fake) vs. real face classification

✅ Clean, responsive Streamlit UI

✅ YOLOv8-based custom trained model

✅ Deployable on Streamlit Cloud
